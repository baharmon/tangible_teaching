@incollection{Harmon2016a,
abstract = {With emerging technologies landscape architects can begin to intuitively model and creatively design dynamic, evolving landscapes. Advances in geospatial modeling, remote sensing, rapid prototyping, and 3d scanning are changing the way that landscapes are modeled. Now we can generate dynamic landscape form with process-based scientific models. We can build precise physical models using remote sensing and rapid prototyping. And we can link physical and digital models with real-time 3d scanning. Our new technology — Tangible Landscape — enables designers to intuitively sculpt a physical model of a landscape coupled with a digital model in a real-time feedback loop of 3d scanning, geospatial modeling, and projection. This bridges the digital-analog divide by combining the kin{\ae}sthetic creativity of traditional modes of design with the analytics and procedural dynamism of geospatial modeling.},
